# 3D Reconstruction Pipeline for Scoliosis Assessment

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of an end-to-end computer vision pipeline developed as part of my Undergraduate Project (UGP) under **Prof. Tushar Sandhan**, Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Kanpur.

The objective of the project is to reconstruct anatomically aligned 3D patient meshes from multi-view video recordings and automatically quantify scoliosis severity using clinically inspired geometric metrics.

# Pipeline Overview

The complete pipeline consists of four major stages.

        │
        ▼
Pre-processing
        │
        ▼
3D Point Cloud Generation (VGGT)
        │
        ▼
Mesh Construction & Refinement
        │
        ▼
Anatomical Axis Alignment
        │
        ▼
Asymmetry Index (AIX) Estimation
```

# Stage 1 — Video Pre-processing

This stage is common for both **Near View** and **Far View** recordings.

# Stage 2 — Mesh Formation

Near-view and far-view meshes are processed independently.

## Far View

```
Point Cloud
      │
      ▼
SOR + ROR Denoising
      │
      ▼
Mesh Generation
      │
      ▼
Mesh Post-processing
```

Since far-view reconstruction contains significantly more noise, adaptive denoising is applied before mesh generation.

---

## Near View

```
Point Cloud
      │
      ▼
(Optional Denoising)
      │
      ▼
Mesh Generation
      │
      ▼
Mesh Post-processing
```

Near-view reconstructions generally contain less noise, making denoising optional.

# Stage 3 — Anatomical Axis Alignment

## Ground Plane Estimation

```
Far Mesh
    │
    ▼
Ground Plane Estimation
    │
    ▼
Y-axis Alignment
```

The ground plane is estimated using a RANSAC-based approach, aligning the global Y-axis with the ground normal.

---

## X-axis Alignment

```
Foot Detection
      │
      ▼
3D Skeletonization
      │
      ▼
X-axis Alignment
```

Foot-based seeding together with skeletonization is used to estimate anatomical orientation.

## Near–Far Mesh Registration

```

# Stage 4 — Asymmetry Index (AIX)

The aligned near-view mesh is used for automated scoliosis quantification.

Current metrics include:

* Hip Center Offset
* Neck Center Offset
* Coronal Offset
* Rib Hump Angle
* Spine Asymmetry
